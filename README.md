### Langevin Dynamics Simulations of Genome Packing in Bacteriophage

We use Langevin dynamics simulations to study the process by which a coarse-grained DNA chain is packaged
within an icosahedral container. We focus our inquiry on three areas of interest in viral packing: the evolving structure of the
packaged DNA condensate; the packing velocity; and the internal buildup of energy and resultant forces. Each of these areas
has been studied experimentally, and we find that we can qualitatively reproduce experimental results. However, our findings
also suggest that the phage genome packing process is fundamentally different than that suggested by the inverse spool
model. We suggest that packing in general does not proceed in the deterministic fashion of the inverse-spool model, but rather
is stochastic in character. As the chain configuration becomes compressed within the capsid, the structure, energy, and packing
velocity all become dependent upon polymer dynamics. That many observed features of the packing process are rooted in
condensed-phase polymer dynamics suggests that statistical mechanics, rather than mechanics, should serve as the proper
theoretical basis for genome packing. Finally we suggest that, as a result of an internal protein unique to bacteriophage T7, the
T7 genome may be significantly more ordered than is true for bacteriophage in general.
